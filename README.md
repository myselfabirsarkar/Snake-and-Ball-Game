**Snake and Ball Game**

Snake and Ball Game is a console based game where the snake grows longer when it eats the "#" character (representing food). The player can control the snake's direction using the keys 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D'. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or, the snake hit the background and if the player decides to exit by pressing 'X’.

#### Rules to Play the Snake Game: 🎯

- Don’t hit a wall and don’t bite your own tail. 
- 10 points will be added to the player’s score for eating the fruit (#). 
- The player’s total score is calculated based on the number of fruits the snake consumed. 
- The length of the snake will be increased after eating the fruits.
